    "The goal of this workshop is to gain familiarity with the computational resources provided by Compute Canada. The workshop will cover aspects of logging in, transfering data, initializing environments, requesting CPU / GPU resources, and relinquishing jobs when you are done using them. To motivate the use of these resources, a deep learning model written in Python will be trained on both CPU and GPU, and the relative performances will be evaluated. \n",

    "# 2. Major Feature: Login Nodes vs. Compute Nodes\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "SHARCNet is a different environment than what you may be used to. Here, you submit a _job_ to a scheduler, which will queue your request for processing until a resource is free. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you connect to SHARCNet, you connect to a _login_ node that serves as a sort-of centralized hub. Login nodes are the only nodes that have internet access, and are useful for tasks such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Submitting jobs to the scheduler\n",
    "* Transfering data to / from the SHARCNet ecosystem\n",
    "* Initializing code environments\n",
    "* Coding / processing very small projects\n",
    "\n",
    "_Compute nodes_ on the other hand, are the main workhorses that are designed to handle heavy code processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1. Interactive Nodes vs. Non-Interactive Nodes\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "When you submit a job to the scheduler, you give it constraints such as the _maximum running time_ and _how much memory is needed_, and the job scheduler will find an appropriate time for your program to run on _non-interactive nodes_. If your program is found to have bugs in it (and it crashes during its alloted execution time), your remaining time will be forfeit and you will be tasked with fixing the code and submitting it for execution again. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive nodes on the other hand, can be used to quickly prototype code on a particular resource. You can request either CPUs or GPUs for a small amount of time, do some interactive programming, and when you're done relinquish the node and submit the job to a non-interactive node. "

    "Since SHARCNet is shared among a large number of researchers, there is no guarantee that resources will always be available for use. Instead, there is a scheduler that chooses when code can run and depends on factors such as priority (e.g. and how much of the resource you've used before), and the amount of resources requested (e.g. memory, many nodes, etc ...). This scheduler is called __SLURM__, and stands for: Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management. \n",
