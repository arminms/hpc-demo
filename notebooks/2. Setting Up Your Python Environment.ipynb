    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "_Python_ is a popular scripting language (where the code is interpreted, __not__ compiled), and is one of the most widely used languages for writing deep learning models. The goal of deep learning is to provide a means to empower computers to process real-world events as humans do: to recognize patterns, to understand a scene, or even to mimic real-world motions such as picking-up and understanding an object. We can accomplish these feats by providing the computer with a large amount data (Gigabyte upon Gigabytes), specifying what we want it to learn, and giving it the computational resources to discover patterns in the data. SHARCNet is a free resource for academic use. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. Deep Learning Frameworks\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been many different frameworks built on the Python language to support the development of deep learning models. These include (but are not limited to):\n",
    "\n",
    "* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) -- Google\n",
    "* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) -- Facebook\n",
    "* [Keras](https://keras.io/) -- Google-ish\n",
    "* [Chainer](https://chainer.org/) -- Preferred Networks (Japanese Company)\n",
    "* [MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/) -- Apache\n",
    "* [Neon](https://ai.intel.com/neon/) -- Nervana (acquired by Intel)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Python Package Managers\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Packaging tools such as [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/) are often used to simplify the process of adding and updating packages, as well as maintaining different python environments. An environment is often associated with a specific project and python distribution. Consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You are working on a project that requires Python=2.7\n",
    "* You are working on another project in parallel that requires Python=3.6\n",
    "\n",
    "By using conda to manage these environments, you can seemlessly switch between tasks without interfering with the global python instance. __It is a good practice to always create a new environment whenever you start a new project__. This ensures that any library dependencies you install don't get contaminated or changed when you want to try something new."
